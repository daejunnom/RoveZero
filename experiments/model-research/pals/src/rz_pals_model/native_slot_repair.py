"""Conditional, unique prepared-lineage witness for one native C D slot.

The retained wire has no D->Reply->Repair->publication causal IDs. This module
does not invent them. It accepts one uniquely observed sequential window of a
reviewed collector/search transition, conditional on independently pinned
caller build/collection observations and registered Rules-only capabilities.
Reply consumption does not prove that Reply's policy selected the response:
the reviewed engine can repair an independently discovered CPU response.

Auxiliary D ownership, ordinary current-row ownership and public raw-source
ownership remain separate. A complete trace can establish not_examined;
incomplete/unsupported evidence cannot. All policy/WDL/task/divergence/ranking,
strategic validity, training and product authorities remain false. No Rules
implementation, callback matching, model forward, loss or process runs here.

In the usual reviewed flow a published Repair is first selected by the next
D query. That exclusive next-D boundary remains not_examined here. Conditional
known covers only an unusually narrow branch/role-limit window with an actual
ordinary selected-public observation before that boundary. The synthetic
known fixture does not prove that path executed in a real collector.
